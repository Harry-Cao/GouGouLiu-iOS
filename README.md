### Download
```
git clone https://github.com/Harry-Cao/GouGouLiu.git
```

### Dependance
In this project, I use [cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org) and [swiftpm](https://www.swift.org/documentation/package-manager/) at the same time. So you still need to set up for dependances that installed by cocoapods.
```
pod install
```
